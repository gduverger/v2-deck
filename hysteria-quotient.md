What is the worry/hysteria quotient?

---

“@benthompson Humanity has a sort of 'worry/hysteria quotient'. If there is a good cause for concern, people will worry about that. If not, they will find something else to worry about. So no matter how good the world gets, people will find reasons to be just as negative as they always were.”  [Source](https://twitter.com/LT3000Lyall/status/1274321465769226241)
